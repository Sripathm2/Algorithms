Some codesd I have written to implement some algorithms for faster processing the data to achieve the correct results.

++Union Find Algorithm - uses id methos to process unions and finds.

++Search Algorithm - uses various data structures and methods to search for all the (x,y) pairs which satisfy the condition (x<xi , y<yi).

++Sorting Algorithm - implements quick three way sorting algorithm to sort the input data.

++Hashing Algorithm - implments the cuckoo hashing method to store data.

++Strongly connected Algorithm - takes in a undirected graph and uses DFS to compute a directed graph. It computes the least amount of links required to make the graph strongly connected.
